This is a [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) bot written in JavaScript for [Node](http://nodejs.org/), based on [Pokemon Showdown Bot](https://github.com/TalkTakesTime/Pokemon-Showdown-Bot). 

This bot is based on commands and features, which are explained [here](https://github.com/Ecuacion/Pokemon-Showdown-Node-Bot/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md). This is intended to ease bot configuration and customization, separating commands in multiple files, multiple features in different folders and merging functions in Global Objects like Bot, CommandParser or Settings. This bot also works in multiple languages at the same time, useful for language rooms.
